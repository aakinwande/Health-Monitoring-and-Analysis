<h1>Health Monitoring and Analysis with Python</h1>

This repository provides Python code and data for performing comprehensive health monitoring and analysis. Health monitoring involves the systematic collection and evaluation of health data to track individuals' or populations' health status over time. This project covers a wide range of activities, from real-time physiological data collection, including heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, to the analysis of more complex health records such as patient history, lifestyle choices, and genetic information.

Key Features:
Data Collection: Utilizes a dataset containing essential health metrics such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, and more.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data by imputing median values and prepares the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Provides insights into the distribution and correlation of health metrics through visualizations and summary statistics.
Analysis by Gender: Examines the distribution and correlation of health metrics based on gender.
Analysis by Activity Level: Investigates the relationship between health metrics and activity levels, such as resting, walking, and running.
Analysis by Sleep Quality and Stress Levels: Explores the impact of sleep quality and stress levels on heart rate and oxygen saturation.
Grouping Patients: Categorizes patients based on age, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation for further analysis.
Visualization of Groups: Visualizes the distribution of patient groups based on various health categories.

Usage:
Clone the repository
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Python scripts to perform health monitoring and analysis.
